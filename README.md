## Features

### 1. Smart XP Banking
The bar doesn't just fill instantly. It "banks" your XP gained during combat and smoothly fills the bar after a short delay once the action settles.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clearly see how much XP you've earned in the last encounter.
*   **Satisfying Animations:** Smooth filling and a "flash" effect when the banked XP is fully added.
*   **Level Up Pulse:** A distinct visual pulse when you hit a new level.

### 2. Time To Level (TTL)
Keep track of your efficiency with real-time statistics.
*   **Progress Info:** Displays current Level and exact percentage (configurable decimal places).
*   **TTL Calculation:** Estimates the time remaining until the next level based on your current XP gain rate.

---

### 3. Themes & Customization
Make it look exactly how you want.
*   **Color Presets:** Choose from professionally designed themes like **SolarFlare**, **MidnightNeon**, **ForestHush**, and more.
*   **Custom Colors:** Fully override theme colors to match your UI.
*   **Positioning:** Attach the bar to your character (with vertical offset) or dock it to the bottom of the screen.
